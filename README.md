## Background

The financial departments of large companies often have to make foreign currency transactions when doing international business, while hedge funds are also interested in anything that will provide an edge in predicting currency movements. Hence, both are always eager to gain a better understanding of the future direction and risk of various currencies. 

To gain proficiency in the following tasks:


1. Time series forecasting
2. Linear regression modelling

## This Repository consist of two Analysis :

* [Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/joannemannuella/Time-Series/blob/main/Analysis/time_series_analysis.ipynb)
* [Regression Analysis](https://github.com/joannemannuella/Time-Series/blob/main/Analysis/regression_analysis.ipynb)

# The Conclusion and Summary from data and analysis done are 

# **Regression Analysis**

Does this model perform better or worse on out-of-sample data as compared to in-sample data?

In-sample Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.841994632894117 Out-of-Sample Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):0.6445805658569028

The higher RMSE result can be a measurement that the sample data did not fit the model well and needs some adjustment in order to be helpful.


# **Time Series Analysis**

Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?

Based on the time series analysis Yen should not be buy this time, however if a good model is found and other factor is also take into decision it might be a good consideration to buy near future.


Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?
    
  
Based on The amount of volatility with Japanese Yen indicates that the currency is very risky to purchase now. Altough both models also showing conflicting results ARIMA predicts that the Yen will decrease when the GARCH indicates that Japanese Yen will increase in value. Until the best model fitting is found and adjusted to right fitting, then it will show a better and accurate risk anyalisis.


Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?


Based on all the models I would NOT suggest using them until the best model fitting is found and adjusted to right fitting, then it will show a better and accurate results.
